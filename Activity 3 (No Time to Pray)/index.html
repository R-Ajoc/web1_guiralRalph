    <h1>No Time To Pray</h1>
    <h2>By K.J. Koshy</h2>

    <p>
      I knelt to pray but no for long,<br> 
      I had too much to do.<br> 
      I had to hurry and get to work <br> 
      For bills would soon be due.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I knelt and said a hurried prayer, </br>
      And jumped up off my knees.<br>
      My Christian duty was now done<br>
      My soul could rest at ease.
    </p>

	  <p>
	    All day long I had no time<br>
	    To spread a word of cheer.<br>
	    No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
	    They'd laugh at me I'd fear 
    </p>

    <p>
    	No time, no time, too much to do, <br>
    	That was my constant cry<br>
    	No time to give to souls in need<br>
    	But at last the time, the time to die.
    </p>

    <p>
    	I went before the Lord,<br>
    	I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br>
    	For in his hands God held a book;<br>
    	It was the book of life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	God looked into his book and said<br>
      <q>
        Your name I cannot find.<br>
      	I once was going to write it down...<br>
      	But never found the time
      </q>
    </p>
